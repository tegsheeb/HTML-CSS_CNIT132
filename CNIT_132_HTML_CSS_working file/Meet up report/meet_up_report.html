<h4> What I have learnt from the event </h4> 
<p>
  For me binary tree was a new concept. So, it was great opportunity to learn new topic
  with fellow group members. We discussed, asked questions from each other. I think it was
  very good stimulating environment to learn new topic. 
  <br>
  Also, it was first time to work on the whiteboard which is valuable experience, as well.

  <br>

  Here is some useful info on Binary Trees and Data structure. <br>
</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://youtu.be/4IrUAqYKjIA" target="_blank">Harvard's CS50 lecture on data structures.</a>
  You can skip ahead to 1:09:32 for trees, but I highly recommend watching the lecture from the beginning. 
  The language is C, but the explanation and examples don't depend on a knowledge of C </li>
